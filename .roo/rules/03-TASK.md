## Completed Tasks

### Core ASR Transcription Implementation
**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Description:** Implement core ASR transcription functionality using NVIDIA NeMo as the first phase of the audio transcription pipeline. This includes audio loading, ASR processing, output formatting, and file writing components.

### Theater-Style Attribution Output Format
**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Description:** Implemented `transcript_attributed.txt` output format that displays speaker attribution in theater play style (e.g., "SPEAKER_00: dialogue text"). This format maintains natural conversation flow and is ideal for meeting transcripts, interviews, and dialog recordings.

**Components Built:**
- [x] `format_as_attributed_text()` method in [`OutputFormatter`](src/audio_aigented/formatting/formatter.py:153)
- [x] `_write_attributed_text_output()` method in [`FileWriter`](src/audio_aigented/output/writer.py:139)
- [x] Updated configuration to include "attributed_txt" format by default
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for formatting logic
- [x] Integration tests for file output functionality
- [x] Updated documentation in README.md

### Speaker Diarization Implementation
**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Description:** Implemented complete speaker diarization functionality using NVIDIA NeMo ClusteringDiarizer to identify and segment different speakers from audio. This enables automatic speaker identification and attribution in transcription outputs.

**Components Built:**
- [x] [`NeMoDiarizer`](src/audio_aigented/diarization/diarizer.py:15) class using NVIDIA NeMo ClusteringDiarizer
- [x] Integration with pipeline as [`diarize`](src/audio_aigented/pipeline.py:196) stage
- [x] Speaker segment detection and labeling with temporal overlap assignment
- [x] [`_assign_speakers_to_segments()`](src/audio_aigented/pipeline.py:342) method for intelligent speaker-to-segment mapping
- [x] Command line option [`--enable-diarization/--disable-diarization`](main.py:62) (default: True)
- [x] GPU-optimized execution with device auto-detection
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests in [`test_diarization.py`](tests/test_diarization.py:1)
- [x] Pipeline integration tests in [`test_pipeline_diarization.py`](tests/test_pipeline_diarization.py:1)
- [x] [`diarization_config.yaml`](config/diarization_config.yaml:1) configuration file
- [x] Updated documentation in README.md with diarization features

## Discovered During Work

### Custom Speaker Mapping System
**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ To Do
**Description:** Implement YAML-based speaker mapping to allow users to assign human-readable names to detected speaker IDs (e.g., SPEAKER_00 â†’ "John Smith").

**Components to Build:**
- [ ] YAML configuration schema for speaker mapping
- [ ] Speaker mapping logic in formatter
- [ ] Configuration validation and error handling
- [ ] Update attributed text output to use mapped names
- [ ] CLI support for specifying speaker mapping files
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Unit tests for mapping functionality

### Performance Caching System Enhancement
**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ To Do
**Description:** Implement comprehensive caching system to avoid re-processing files and improve performance as mentioned in the original planning document.

**Components to Build:**
- [ ] File-based caching for transcription results
- [ ] Model caching for ASR and diarization models
- [ ] Cache invalidation based on file modification times
- [ ] Cache management CLI commands (clear, status, etc.)
- [ ] Configurable cache policies and size limits
- [ ] Unit tests for caching logic
